# PasswordGenerator
The project is to develop a password generator. The password lenght and character types are determined by the user. When the user presses the "Password Generator" button, the code generates and displays in a central box a random password, fitting the user's choices. 

## Motivation
This project is homework03 from UT Coding Bootcamp.

### Prerequisites
The software will run in any webpage

## Tests 
* Password length: The password lenght is determined by the user, from a pre-defined range of 8 to 128 characters. Any length chosen outside this range is not accepted, a warning message displayed and the input prompt for password length returns to the screen. 
* Character type choice: The user can choose the types of characters to be used in the generated password result - special chacters, numbers, lowercase, uppercase. The combination can range from one character type to all four. 
* Prompts and alerts: Verification that all input described above is correctly done via prompts and alerts.
* Button for password generation: There is a "generate password" button in the bottom of the page that when pressed displays the new generated password in a box in the center of the page.
